# ml-engineering-task

With this task, we would like to see how you solve problems with code. It’s not about finding the best model or developing a finished app.

## Description

The dataset you will use for this task is the [Tomato Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/tomato-detection/data) from Kaggle.

1. Analyze the Data: Visualize samples of images with bounding boxes. Then, plot the distribution of the number of objects per image and the bounding box sizes. This part of the task can be completed in a notebook.
2. Train a Model: Train an object detector to recognize tomatoes. The detections should not be random, but the task is not about squeezing out the last percentage points of performance. This part of the task should be completed in a Python module.
3. Evaluation: Evaluate the model’s performance based on the dataset. Choose a suitable metric for object detection and visualize the results.
4. Documentation: Document how to execute your code in this README so that another engineer could rerun your experiments. Ensure that all necessary components for reproducibility are checked into the repository.

The task should be fully implemented in Python, but you can use any libraries and tools you want. When deciding
between different deep learning libraries, Pytorch is preferable.
Your complete solution should be committed to a separate branch. Once you are finished, create a pull request against the `main` branch.
